            <h2>About Me</h2>
        	<p>I am a 45 year old mother of two that made
                a bold decision to go to college and start a new career.  So far, this has been
                a very positive experience!  (thank goodness)</p>
            
            <p>I have been working in an office as secretary, bookkeeper, customer service, and
                administrative assistant for 16 years.  It was time for a change.</p>
            
            <p>As I was searching the Internet for online schools, Full Sail popped up over and over
                again.  I clicked to check out what they had to offer.  I have always been interested
                in computers and have taught myself how to use them efficiently but I am no artist!
                Web Design and Development! Perfect!</p>

            <h2>Header</h2>
                <p>
                    This is an image from a cooking and recipe website. The social media banner at the top immediately grabs the user's attention by using colors that make you feel:</p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>light blue - peaceful, calm</li>
                        <li>bright blue - happy, energetic</li>
                        <li>bright pink -  happy, fun, energetic</li>
                        <li>bright green -  trendy, lively</li>
                        <li>yellow - cheerful, friendly</li>
                        <li>purple - sweet tasting, nostalgic</li>
                        
                    </ul> 
                    <p>
                    This is the pallet of the whole site, colorful and happy.  Users that come to this site are mostly women and the colors chosen reflect that.

            <h2>Footer</h2>
                <p>
                    This footer comes from Amazon.com.  There is a lot of information here.  Bright orange is used on headings to show hierarchy.  Orange is energizing, friendly and loud which makes this stand out.  Users that scroll down to this footer are in need of very specific information, something that can not be found in the contents of the page or the normal navigation bar.  The footer has global information, career information as well as links for people who want to invest, advertise, become an affiliate or sell items.  Amazon used clean lines and grids to list the information so it would be easy to find for the user.

                <p>
                    This blog is from Crazy for Crusts cooking website.  The blog runs down along the right side of the
                    page.  By using colorful pictures, the user is drawn in to reading the comments and posts.  This website
                    is geared toward foodies and people who love to cook.  Fun, bright colors are used to emphasize titles and features.

            <h2>Account Info</h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon.com has a very thourough accounts page.  After the user logs in, a simple mouse over the tab marked account
                    will drop down a menu with a lengthy list of options along with items recently purchased in
                    case you want to buy them again.  Amazon.com targets online shoppers of all kinds and people looking
                    for bargains.  Even though their site includes a tremendous amount of information, it is all very well
                    organized using drop downs, which make it easy for the user to navigate.

                <p>
                    This contacts page comes from my bank.  The users for this site are very specific to be sure.  Only people living in middle Tennesee who are looking for a new bank or users who are already members will use this site.  This is a local bank with only 12 branches in middle Tennessee.  <br>The colors used are bright but relaxing, they give the
                    feeling of stability and comfort.  Bright blues and greens represent energy and friendiness.  This page is found in the navigation bar at the top of the home page.  One click brings the user here.  The user does not have to wade through pages of
                    information to a phone number or branch location.

            <h2>Call to Action</h2>
                <p>
                    This call to action is from Old Navy.  Talk about straight to the point.  A picture of their featured
                    items and sale information with a handy "shop now" link takes you directly to the sale items.  With the
                    use of unique fonts of varying sizes and an exciting bright color (red is stimulating, sexy and powerful), this CTA takes the user to the exact
                    place Old Navy wants them.  Statistics show that men <strong>AND</strong> women make purchases online between the ages of 18 to 24. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-demographics-of-who-shops-online-and-on-mobile-2014-8">(demographics)</a>

            <h2>Registration</h2>
                <p>
                    Best Buy has a very easy registration page.  A light blue box makes some information more important
                    so the user will pay attention to it.  This info makes it easier to sign up if the user has already
                    joined the My Best Buy club or applied for a credit card.  The website will pull the rest of the user’s
                    info from that database.  More blue is used…

            <h2>Login</h2>
                <p>
                    The login page for Flixster is easy as pie.  There is an option to sign in with Facebook or Google
                    to save the user the time of filling out the registration form.  This is also the area to login if
                    you already have an account.  A remember me option is available as well as a forgot password link for
                    those who did register.  People who use Flixster usually have a digital movie library and are ready
                    to watch a flick, not fill out forms.
