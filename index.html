        	<p>Who is Shannon R. Williams?  I am a 45 year old mother of two that made a bold decision to go to college 			and start a new career.  So far, this has been a very positive experience!  (thank goodness)</p>
            
            <p>I have been working in an office as secretary, bookkeeper, customer service, and administrative assistant for 16 years.  It was time for a change.</p>
            
            <p>As I was searching the Internet for what I wanted to do when I grow up, web design and development kept coming up in the online school degree programs.  I have always been interested in computers and have taught myself how to use them efficiently (with a little help from my dad, computer specialist for 35 years)</p>
