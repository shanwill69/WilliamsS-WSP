        	<p>Who is Shannon R. Williams?<br> <br>  I am a 45 year old mother of two that made a bold decision to go to college 			and start a new career.  So far, this has been a very positive experience!  (thank goodness)</p>
            
            <p>I have been working in an office as secretary, bookkeeper, customer service, and administrative assistant for 16 years.  It was time for a change.</p>
            
            <p>As I was searching the Internet for online schools, Full Sail popped up over and over again.  I clicked to check out what they had to offer.  I have always been interested in computers and have taught myself how to use them efficiently but I am no artist!  Web Design and Development! Perfect!</p>
