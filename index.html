        	<p>Who is Shannon R. Williams?<br> <br>  I am a 45 year old mother of two that made
                a bold decision to go to college and start a new career.  So far, this has been
                a very positive experience!  (thank goodness)</p>
            
            <p>I have been working in an office as secretary, bookkeeper, customer service, and
                administrative assistant for 16 years.  It was time for a change.</p>
            
            <p>As I was searching the Internet for online schools, Full Sail popped up over and over
                again.  I clicked to check out what they had to offer.  I have always been interested
                in computers and have taught myself how to use them efficiently but I am no artist!
                Web Design and Development! Perfect!</p>

                    An image from a cooking and recipe website.  This header is so pretty.  It makes the user
                    think of grandma’s kitchen.  The social media banner at the top is colorful and happy.
                    This is the pallet of the whole site, colorful and happy.  Users that come to this site are
                    looking for comforting recipes and tips from other people’s kitchens.  Nothing fancy, just good
                    home cooking.

                    This footer comes from Amazon.com.  There is a lot of information here but Amazon places it in
                    clean lists and categories.  Bright orange is used on headings to show hierarchy.   This footer is
                    used for gaining information not listed in the main site as well as information about careers and global info.

                    The target audience for Bluebird is people who need credit cards but don’t want
                    an annual fee or to have a credit check.  The <strong>ABOUT</strong> page clearly states all of
                    the features offered by Bluebird.  There is even a short video to help explain more
                    about the company. The design is clean and simple.  Nothing fancy or confusing about
                    this page which makes the user feel comfortable.  Blues and greens are calming and trustworthy colors.

                    This blog is from Crazy for Crusts cooking website.  The blog runs down along the right side of the
                    page.  By using colorful pictures, the user is drawn in to reading the comments and posts.  This website
                    is geared toward foodies and people who love to cook.  Fun, bright colors are used to emphasize titles and features.

                    Amazon.com has the best account page around.  After you login, mouse over the tab marked account
                    and a drop down menu pops up with a lengthy list of options along with items recently purchased in
                    case you want to buy them again.  Amazon.com targets online shoppers of all kinds and people looking
                    for bargains.  Even though their site includes a tremendous amount of information, it is all very well
                    organized using drop downs, which make it easy for the user to navigate.

                <p class="description">
                    This contacts page comes from my bank.  Even though the colors used are bright, they still give the
                    feeling of stability and comfort.  (blues and greens again)  The page for contacts is minimal and gives
                    very few options, which is straight to the point.  The user does not have to wade through pages of
                    information to get what they need.

                    use of unique fonts of varying sizes and an exciting bright color, this CTA takes the user to the exact
                    place Old Navy wants them.

                <p class="description">
                    Best Buy has a very easy registration page.  A light blue box makes some information more important
                    so the user will pay attention to it.  This info makes it easier to sign up if the user has already
                    joined the My Best Buy club or applied for a credit card.  The website will pull the rest of the user’s
                    info from that database.  More blue is used…

                    The login page for Flixster is easy as pie.  There is an option to sign in with Facebook or Google
                    to save the user the time of filling out the registration form.  This is also the area to login if
                    you already have an account.  A remember me option is available as well as a forgot password link for
                    those who did register.  People who use Flixster usually have a digital movie library and are ready
                    to watch a flick, not fill out forms.
