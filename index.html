            <h2>About Me</h2>
        	<p>I am a 45 year old mother of two that made
                a bold decision to go to college and start a new career.  So far, this has been
                a very positive experience!  (thank goodness)</p>
            
            <p>I have been working in an office as secretary, bookkeeper, customer service, and
                administrative assistant for 16 years.  It was time for a change.</p>
            
            <p>As I was searching the Internet for online schools, Full Sail popped up over and over
                again.  I clicked to check out what they had to offer.  I have always been interested
                in computers and have taught myself how to use them efficiently but I am no artist!
                Web Design and Development! Perfect!</p>
